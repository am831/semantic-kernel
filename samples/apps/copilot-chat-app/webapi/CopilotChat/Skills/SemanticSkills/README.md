# Copilot Chat Semantic Skills

## prompt.txt

These files contain the prompt template that is completed by filling out the variables and function calls in the template to generate a prompt that is sent to the LLM model for completion when that particular Semantic function is called.

## Config.json

These files accompany the promp.txt files. They configure the completion settings for the LLM model that gets called; They also define the variables used inside the prompt.

Completion settings control how a function is run by an LLM model. Learn more about it [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/prompt-engineering/configure-prompts). The values we have chosen for frequency_penalty, presence_penalty, and temperature have been found to give a good mix of variability and naturalness to the conversation responses generated by the LLM. A more niche semantic function might work better with different values. We recommend playing around with these settings to find what works best for you.
The max_token param we use in the various functions defined under SemanticSkills is different for each of these functions. Different skills can weave the Semantic functions in different combinations to generate a bigger prompt that is then sent to the LLM model. We adjust max_tokens for each prompt completion so that each skill thats part of a bigger prompt doesn't take up an incongruous portion of the final prompt. For example, the SemanticSkill.Chat function under the  combines together the ExtractAudience, ExtractUserIntent and the ChatSkill.ChatHistory functions. We limit ExtractAudience to 256 tokens so that the chat participant list in the worst case does not take up more than 6.25% (assuming the token limit of the LLM model is 4096 tokens) of the final prompt. Similarly we have weighed the max_tokens for each of the semantic functions defined under SemanticSkills
